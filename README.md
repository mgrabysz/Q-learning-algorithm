# Q-learning algorithm

An agent searches for the shortest path in a maze using Q-learning algorithm

Q-learning is a type of algorithm in which a certain agent moves in given environment (performs available actions). As a result, agent changes a state (a state can be for example a square on a board). For performing specific acion in specific state, agent is given an adequate reward. Agent's ultimate goal is to maximize received reward.
